# Radially Symmetrical Gyroid Generator

## ðŸš§ Work in Progress ðŸš§

This project is currently under active development. Features and functionality may change, and there might be bugs or incomplete aspects.


## Description

The Radially Symmetrical Gyroid Generator is a Python-based application that allows users to create and visualize customizable gyroid structures. It provides a graphical user interface for adjusting various parameters to generate unique, radially symmetrical gyroid models.

## Current Features

- Interactive GUI for parameter input
- Real-time 3D visualization of the generated gyroid
- Customizable gyroid properties (dimensions, cell sizes, wall thickness, etc.)
- Dual-color visualization with adjustable intersect angle
- STL/OBJ export functionality for 3D printing

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- PyQt5
- PyVista
- NumPy
- trimesh

### Steps

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gyroid-generator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd gyroid-generator
   ```
3. Create Virtual Environment (optional but reccomended)
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt # or pip install numpy pyvista trimesh PyQt5 pyvistaqt
   ```

## Usage

Run the application by executing:

```
python gyroid.py
```

Use the GUI to adjust parameters and generate your custom gyroid structure. Click "Generate Gyroid" to create the model and "Save STL" to export it.
After export, the walls of the inner structure need thickening. This can be acomplished using Blender.

1. Open blender and delete the cube.
2. File > Import > STL (.stl)
3. Apply wireframe to better visualise the mesh.
4. Apply a solid modifier with 0 offset to a thickness of your choice to the model
5. Apply a remesh modifier to smooth things out
6. File > Export > STL (.stl)

7. I found that I needed to "Cut" the model at the top (save bottom object), and the bottom (save top object) in order to have flat surfaces to print
8. Slice and print!

## Known Issues

- Performance may degrade with very high resolution settings
- Some parameter combinations may produce unexpected results

## Planned Features

- [ ] Improved error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Additional gyroid types and variations
- [ ] Performance optimizations for handling higher resolutions
- [ ] More export options (e.g., OBJ, STEP formats)
- [ ] Undo/Redo functionality
- [ ] Importing .STL or other bodies to use as an implicit body to apply gyroid latticing
